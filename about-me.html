    <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
    <hr />
    <p>I am Mark Herren Diaz Nuega,
age 40, Electronics and Electrical
Technician since year 2009 (16
years on Technical In-House &
Field Service Experience).
<br />
Always willing to take initiative
with responsibility on all my duty
and schedules with all my
dedication and hardworks ready
at all times.
<br />
Always wanted myself to take
challenges resolving issues and
problem usually during the company
difficulties and see the
maximum ability and potential I
have in myself as an active
worker and leader to lead.
<br />I have a lot of experiences gained
thru difficulties and failure to
success that is ready to be used
for the benefits of many.
<br />My dream is not just for myself but
for everyone I am with and I am
caring for, specially my family and my work.
<br />Always aiming high whether it is
thru the hardship or challenges
and difficulties, knowing that after
going over to this kind of
experience I will learn and correct
faults and mistakes in my next
step...
<br />
Also had a lot of experience from
laboring to supervisory level,
therefore I knew the actual
scenario on the field where most
worker should be knowledgeable
and skilled to do their task on time
and on a high standard of service.
